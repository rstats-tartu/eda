## EDA
Exploratory data analysis is iterative process* where you:

1. Generate questions about your data.

2. Search for answers by visualising, transforming, and modelling your data.

3. Use what you learn to refine your questions and/or generate new questions.

class:inverse, middle

- EDA **is not** a formal process with a strict set of rules.

- You should feel free to investigate every idea that occurs to you.

- EDA is an important part of any data analysis because you always need to investigate the quality of your data.

## WHO cancer facts 

- Cancer and specially lung cancer is becoming one of the leading causes of mortality.

- In year 2012. cancer claimed 8.2 million lives worldwide, European Union had 15% share (1.27 million).

- Most cancer deaths are caused by lung-, liver-, stomach-, colorectal-, and breast cancer.

- Most frequent cancer types are different in females and males.

- Predictions show that cancer incidence increases from 14 million in 2012. to 22 million in 2030-ties.

## Questions
By using Estonian cancer incidence data we want to understand:

1. **What is the cancer incidence trend in Estonia?**

2. **What are the most frequent cancer sites?**

3. **What is the most frequent cancer type in men and in women?**

## Cancer data from Estonian Cancer Registry

- Estonian cancer registry data is available via [Health statistics and health research database](http://pxweb.tai.ee/PXWeb2015/pxweb/en/02Haigestumus/02Haigestumus__04Pahaloomulised%20kasvajad/?tablelist=true&rxid=279523e2-1ea1-4a02-920b-f85bb19a908d).
- We are using cancer incidence dataset from table "PK10: New cases of malignant neoplasms by specified site, sex and age group".
- Detailed information about variables in this dataset can be found from [here](http://pxweb.tai.ee/PXWeb2015/Resources/PX/Databases/02Haigestumus/04Pahaloomulised%20kasvajad/PKinfo_en.htm).


```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.cap="Screen caption from dataset download page. Note that data was downloaded in JSON format.",out.width=360, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/pk10-page.png")
```

---

## Download PK10 dataset

- This dataset is available on https://github.com/rstats-tartu/datasets

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## url to file
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstats-tartu/datasets/master/cancer_newcases_PK10.json"

## issues warning when dir exists
dir.create("data")

## download data
download.file(url, "data/cancer_incidence_PK10.json")
```

---

## Load libraries

- First we load "tidyverse" library. 

- We are going to need also "stringi" and "stringr" libraries for string manipulation.

- "broom" package converts S3 model object into dataframes for tidy handling.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(stringi)
library(stringr)
library(broom)
```

---

## Import and prepare data

We import dataset using `json_to_df()` function from "boulder" library. 

You can install "boulder" from github "[tpall/boulder](https://github.com/tpall/boulder)":
"boulder" package has few helper functions and was created to work specificly with Estonian Health Statistics and Health Research Database.
However, "boulder" package is still under development and you should use it carefully.

```{r}
# devtools::install_github("tpall/boulder")
library(boulder)
path <- "data/cancer_newcases_PK10.json"
cases <- json_to_df(path)
```

---

```{r}
filter(cases, str_length(`Specified site`)<20) # see note
```

.footnote[
For better overview we filtered out long Specified site values.
